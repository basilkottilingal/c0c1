# Overview
 
  Interested in developing lexers ( read source code token by token ) ?
  Here is a minimal effort.

  The script can be used to create lexer source file like unix lex/
  GNU [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) (note : flex is no more
  an official GNU package). For portability, it accepts flex's grammar
  file with few exceptions in the patterns.
  The main [API](https://github.com/basilkottilingal/lexer/blob/main/src/lxr/api.c)
  function are

```c
void lxr_source     ( const char * source );
void lxr_read_bytes ( const unsigned char * bytes, size_t len );
int  lxr_input      ( );
int  lxr_unput      ( );
void lxr_clean      ( );
```
  In case lexer function's signature (YYSTYPE) is not provided by the user,
  the default lexer function will look like
```c
int lxr_lex ();
```

# Tokenizer or Lexer reader

  Creates a lexer generator header from a .lex file. Input file supports
  same format as of flex's input file.

  Convert a lexer grammar file to lexer source file as follows.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:basilkottilingal/lexer.git
cd lexer
make lxr
./lxr -o c99.c c99.lex
```

  (fixme : export to bashrc. Might need LXRPATH also!!)

## Input file
  Input file format is the same as specified by flex
```
definitions
%%
rules
%%
user code
```
  There are few exceptions
  1. flex options will be ignored
  2. The OR operator as in the following cases are not-implemented
```lex
%%
"foo" |
"bar" { /*foo or bar : action */ }
%%
```
  Instead you can use single line OR operato, where action falls in the same
  line as the pattern and there are no unwanted white spaces
```lex
%%
"foo"|"bar" { /*foo or bar : action */ }
%%
```

### Regex

  1. Support most of POSIX ERE symbols in the lexer grammar.
  2. Following regular expression are implemented

| Symbol   | Name         | Meaning / Description                                                   |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.`      | Dot  | Matches **any single character** except newline (`\n`)                          |
| `^`      | Beginning anchor | Matches the **start of a line**                                     |
| `$`      | End anchor   | Matches the **end of a line**                                           |
| `[...]`  | Character class  | Matches **any one character** in the set                            |
| `[^...]` | Negated character class  | Matches **any one character not** in the set                |
| `\|`     | Alternation  | Matches **either of the pattern** before o after `\|` in the current group |
| `()`     | Grouping     | Groups expressions as a single unit, affects alternation and repetition |
| `*`      | Zero or more | Matches **zero or more** repetitions of the preceding expression        |
| `+`      | One or more  | Matches **one or more** repetitions of the preceding expression         |
| `?`      | Zero or one  | Matches **zero or one** occurrence of the preceding expression          |
| `{n}`    | Exact repetition | Matches **exactly n** occurrences of the preceding expression       |
| `{n,}`   | Lower-bounded repetition | Matches **n or more** occurrences                           | 
| `{,m}`   | Upper-bounded repetition | Matches **atmost m** occurrences                            | 
| `{n,m}`  | Bounded repetition   | Matches **between n and m** occurrences (inclusive)             |
| `\`      | Escape | Removes special meaning from the next character (e.g., `\.` matches a literal `.`) |

  3. Additionally uses quotes (ex : `"foo"`) for string matching as in flex
  4. NOTE : DOESN'T support any kind of pattern lookahead assertions.
```lex
foo/bar    { /* foo is followed by bar */ }
foo(?=bar) { /* foo is followed by bar */ } 
foo(?!bar) { /* foo is not followed by bar */ } 
```
  So it's upto user to handle these look ahead patterns by appropriate alternative methods
  like using appropriate context sensitive parser, or implementing a lookahead
  using `lxr_input()` and/or `lxr_unput()`

  5. NOTE : DOESN'T support EOF as in flex
```lex
<<EOF>>    { /* flex allows EOF action, but not allowed in this code */ }
```

## Regex pattern matching using NFA.

  The same script can be used to look if a text satisfies regex pattern
```c
  #include "regex.h"
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main () {
    char rgx[] = "(a|b)*c";
    char str[] = "aac";
    int len = rgx_nfa_match (rgx, str); // returns > 0, if successfull
    if (len) {
      char holdchar = str [len-1];
      str [len-1] = '\0';
      printf ("substring \"%s\" matched pattern \"%s\"", str, rgx);
      str [len-1] = holdchar;
    }
  }
```

## ToDo

  1. Remove non-reached states
  2. YYSTYPE not tested for return type other than `int`
  3. OR operator ('|') for multiple patterns with same action
  4. garbage collection : deallocate () in case memory is constrained
